# Culinary Combinations
Culinary Combinations is a cooking game show-inspired board game in which players (referred to as
Contestants) travel around a circular Track, collecting Ingredients to add to their Kitchen. The goal
of each Contestant is to, by the end of each Round, hold a combination or arrangement of
Ingredients that has the highest number of Matches to Ingredients on the Chefâ€™s Request.

## Origins
Culinary Combinations was developed for a data management course as a project applying the concepts of combinations,
permutations and probability. Over 50 students participated in the final testing of the project.

## This Repository
This repository contains a Python file that was used to fully simulate the board game both with human players and
randomized computer player in order to verify that the chances of winning were fair and that the game mechanics
worked as intended during the early stages of production.
